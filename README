# HelloPhoneGapAndroid

A simple project that demonstrates using ClojureScript with PhoneGap,
targeting Android.

This project is *very* preliminary - do not take it as an indication
that this is how you should do things.

## Building and Installing

To build and install the project, type

```
ant clean debug install
```

You will need to have an Android device or emulator attached and
running. After completion of this command, a native app called "App"
will appear on the device.

## Structure

The HTML page for the application appears in the
`assets/www/index.html` file. The ClojureScript that drives the app is
located in `src/cljs/HelloPhoneGap.cljs`. The `ant debug install` task
will invoke `lein cljsbuild once` to compile the ClojureScript to the
`assets/www/main.js` file that is referenced by `index.html`.
